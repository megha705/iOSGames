iOS games from Mobile App Development class at SJSU

1) Developed a game to concentrate and flip the crads. The game allows for score keeping, keeping track of a start and end game, and a flip count.

    - You can run the game by cloning the master branch, open it in xcode, open the project file and check the iOS version, then run the simulation on an iphone or using the iOS simulator on macOS.
